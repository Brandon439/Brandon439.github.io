# Current Plans

Currently I plan to dump everything I know about data science in this blog so that in case I forget anything (which I will), I can use this as an archive.

Any code will be written in either Python or R.

The main audience will be for undergraduate math students who have a firm background in linear algebra, as well as some knowledge in programming and statistics. 
It will take a long time for everything to look nice. Thanks for your patience!
